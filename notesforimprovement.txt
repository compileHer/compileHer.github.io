TO-DO List for compile/Her:

MAIN:
- fix header logo ... this will be the five girls (cyan, vert etc.)
evenly spaced between the links to the other pages. They will
be properly sized, but they won't increase the width of the header
- One page vs. Multi-page style? Where does compile/Her stand on
this? If one page, what info should I cut?
- Opinions on the footer? too little info? (I figured since the
header was always present I didn't need much in the footer ...
social media buttons should be bigger. Is the logo okay to use
here?)
- Is the white-based theme okay? How about hot pink? Do you like
the colors?

index.html
-Change background image or fix word positioning. The contrast
color should be more visible. Also, change the image to pink
shirts from the original page ... this should match the theme 
better.
-Apply the special font to the title ... I need to download this.

about.html
- Should there be special hover effects to the pics of the team?
- Provide additional about write-up ... elaborate on mission.
- Set either the name or the position to the accent color.

upcoming.html
- Do you like the side-by-side? Or should it scroll one-by-one
like the sponsors? Or should I have a brief descriptions with 
a link to learn more?

past.html
- Same as upcoming.html

workshops.html
- What picture to include here?
- Include contact form.
- Include a better write-up for the workshops in the 
description.
- Are pictures necessary here?

gallery.html
- Should the gallery be scrolling down or side-by-side 
(like the sponsors)? Should I divide pictures by event?
(for example, http://www.bridgerbiathlonclub.org/gallery/ 
this is my reference).
